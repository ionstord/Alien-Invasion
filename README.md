# Alien-Invasion

This is a practice project from the python crash course (Project 1, chapters 12 to 14).

Goals:
Classic game of space invaders. UFOs move side to side and closer to the space ship. If a UFO touches your space ship or the
bottom of the screen, you lose a life. You have 3 lives, in addition to your first one. Once you run out of lives the game
restarts. After clearing each fleet of aliens, the difficulty increases by increasing the speed at which they move and approach
the ship/bottom of the screen.

Controls:
Move the ship side to side using the arrow keys.
Fire a missile using the space button. Only three missiles can be fired at a time.

Run alien_invasion.py to play the game.

Enjoy!
